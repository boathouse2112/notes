# Arm

Raspberry Pi 4 is a Broadcom BCM 2711 Quad-core Cortex A-72 (Arm v8) 64-bit

## Documentation

- Arm architecture reference manual for A-Profile Architecture
  - ~13,000 pages. I think this is equivalent to the intel ISA manual
- ARM Cortex-A Series Programmer's guide for ARMv8-A
  - ~300 pages

## Startup

- RPI kernel is loaded at 0x8_0000
  - TODO -- Source? Is it RPI-specific?
